# R_Analysis
## Project Summary
-In this module, you’ll apply your understanding of statistics and hypothesis testing to analyze a series of datasets from the automotive     industry

Throughout the module, you’ll extract, transform, and load (ETL) data; visualize the data; and analyze the data using R. Additionally, you’ll learn a variety of statistical tests, their real-world application in data science, and their implementation in R. The goal is for you to apply these statistical concepts beyond this 

## Objectives
- Load, clean up, and reshape datasets using tidyverse in R.
- Visualize datasets with basic plots such as line, bar, and scatter plots using ggplot2.
- Generate and interpret more complex plots such as boxplots and heatmaps using ggplot2.
- Plot and identify distribution characteristics of a given dataset.
- Formulate null and alternative hypothesis tests for a given data problem.
- Implement and evaluate simple linear regression and multiple linear regression models for a given dataset.
- Implement and evaluate the one-sample t-Tests, two-sample t-Tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) models for a given dataset.
- Implement and evaluate a chi-squared test for a given dataset.
- Identify key characteristics of A/B and A/A testing.
- Determine the most appropriate statistical test for a given hypothesis and dataset.

## Challenge Summary  
- Design and interpret a multiple linear regression analysis to identify variables of interest.
- Calculate summary statistics for quantitative variables.
- Perform a t-test in R and provide interpretation of results.
- Design your own statistical study to compare vehicle performance of two vehicles.
